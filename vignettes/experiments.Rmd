## Simulating cophylogenetic datasets

We simulate four levels of the following three parameters:
 
* host-switching
* cospeciation
* extinction

These parameter values were (0, 1, 2, 3). The first (0,0,0) of these produces two trees with random associations as there is no events causing a dependence between host and symbiont trees.

The remaining parameters were set to be the same in all analyses. 




```{r simulation}
